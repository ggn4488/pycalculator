# pycalculator - A simple calculator in Python

This is, I think, a good starting point for learning Python's syntax and data structures.
This calculator lets the user choose between 5 arithmetic operations to do between 2 numbers.
It also let's the user do operations over and over again until it is not necessary anymore.
I've uploaded two files: a .py and a notebook.
